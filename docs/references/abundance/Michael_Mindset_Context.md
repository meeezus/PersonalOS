## THE CORE WOUND (Age 5 - Carousel Memory)

**The Incident:**
At age 5, at a store, a merry-go-round was running. Mom told Michael to jump on. When he did, it stopped. He wanted his mom to buy him a ride for 25 cents since he didn't get to actually ride it. She said no. His response:
- Threw a fit
- Tried to crash the car on the drive home
- Told his mother "I hate you"
- Passed out (family narrative: "he was just tired" - minimizing his emotional state)

**What This Reveals:**
1. **Powerlessness:** "I want something and I can't have it and I have no control"
2. **Rage at being denied:** Explosive, destructive response (trying to crash car)
3. **Shame/collapse after explosion:** Saying "I hate you" then dissociating/passing out
4. **Needs being minimized:** "You were just tired" instead of validating the pain
5. **The birth of the core belief:** "I can't make shit happen"

---

## THE CORE LIMITING BELIEF

**Primary Belief:** "I can't make shit happen"

**How This Manifests in Adult Life:**

### Pattern 1: Helping Others Instead of Building Own Empire
- **Tricia's business (DecoponATX):** Taking lead on strategy, outreach, website, automation - but it's HER business
- **BJJ gym:** Building tools for them, wanting to help coach/organization - but it's THEIR thing
- **Health coaching:** Had pilot clients but no energy to build own content/brand

**Why:** If HER thing fails, it's not proof that HE can't make shit happen. If HIS thing fails, it confirms his deepest fear.

### Pattern 2: Guru-Seeking & Need for Guarantees
- **Bought multiple Dan Koe courses:** 2 Hour Writer, Digital Economics, Building a Personal Brand in 30 Days, Mental Monetization
- **Craves external authority:** Looks to mentors (like this conversation) and Hormozi for "permission" and guarantee of success
- **Why:** That 5-year-old is still asking "Mom, can I have the ride?" = "Please tell me this will work. Please guarantee I won't get hurt."

### Pattern 3: Scattering Energy Across Multiple Projects
- **Active interests:** DecoponATX, BJJ x AI tools, health coaching, building in public, newsletter/Substack writing
- **Why:** If he has 5 backup plans, no single failure proves "I can't make shit happen"
- **Result:** Never fully commits to ONE thing, so nothing reaches critical mass

### Pattern 4: Analysis Paralysis & Productive Procrastination
- **Research over execution:** Reads books, takes courses, builds research systems (Exa/Websets strategy)
- **"Building tools" as distraction:** Wants to build automation instead of manually sending emails
- **"I don't have authority yet":** Despite building working BJJ app that got influencer interest (Jack Krucial)
- **Why:** Staying in preparation mode means never risking the moment of truth where he might fail

---

## THE PATTERN IN ACTION (Current Situation)

**The Setup:**
- Has complete 60-day roadmap for DecoponATX
- Has all tools, contacts, templates ready
- Monday launch: send 90 emails to Austin corporate prospects
- Clear path to $3K/month in 60 days

**The Resistance:**
- Right before execution, pivots to "I need to work on mindset/quantum energy/manifestation"
- Asks about building automation tools instead of just executing
- Seeks permission/guarantee from mentor (me, Hormozi, universe)

**The Recognition:**
- Caught himself doing the pattern
- Acknowledged: "I see the pattern of distraction instead of execution"
- Named the real fear: "I'd feel like a failure and I can't make shit happen"

**The Breakthrough:**
- Recognized he can't intellectualize his way into the new identity
- Must ACT AS IF he's someone who can make shit happen, even while not feeling it
- Committed to sending 90 emails even while the voice says "you can't make shit happen"

---

## THE NEW COMMITMENT (Week of Dec 30 - Jan 3)

**The Challenge:** Send 90 cold emails to Austin companies to book corporate DecoponATX events

**The Real Challenge:** Prove to the 5-year-old that he CAN want something, go for it, possibly fail, and survive

**Daily Targets:**
- Monday: 15 emails
- Tuesday: 20 emails
- Wednesday: 20 emails
- Thursday: 20 emails
- Friday: 15 emails
- **Total: 90 emails**

**Expected Results:**
- 10-20% reply rate = 9-18 responses
- 1-3 discovery calls booked
- Potentially 1 event closed

**The Actual Win:**
Regardless of results, the win is: **He sent 90 emails even when the voice said "you can't make shit happen"**

---

## WHAT NEEDS TO BE TRACKED DAILY

### Morning Check-In
1. **Current emotional state:** How am I feeling about today's outreach?
2. **The voice of doubt:** What is the limiting belief saying right now?
3. **Acknowledgment:** "I see you, little Michael. I'm doing it anyway."
4. **Affirmation:** Not forcing belief, but stating intention: "I am willing to find out if I can make this happen"

### Action Tracking
1. **Emails sent today:** (target varies by day)
2. **Replies received:** (any response, positive or negative)
3. **Discovery calls booked:** (meetings scheduled)
4. **Events closed:** (actual revenue generated)

### Evening Reflection
1. **Wins:** What went well today? (even tiny wins count)
2. **Resistance moments:** When did the voice show up? What did it say?
3. **How I responded:** Did I act anyway or did I collapse into distraction?
4. **Evidence of capability:** What proof did I create today that I CAN make shit happen?

### Weekly Integration
1. **Total volume:** Did I hit 90 emails?
2. **Results:** Reply rate, calls booked, revenue generated
3. **Pattern recognition:** When did I want to scatter/distract/seek gurus?
4. **Identity shift:** Do I feel any different about my capability?

## KEY MINDSET SHIFTS TO REINFORCE

### Old Identity → New Action
- **Old:** "I can't make shit happen" → Avoid, distract, help others
- **New:** "I'm willing to find out" → Act as if, regardless of feeling

### From Helping Others → Building Own Empire
- **Old pattern:** Tricia's business, BJJ gym's tools, other people's dreams
- **New pattern:** This week is about MY capability to execute, MY ability to generate results

### From Seeking Guarantees → Embracing Uncertainty
- **Old:** "Tell me this will work" (gurus, courses, mentors)
- **New:** "I don't know if this will work, and I'm doing it anyway"

### From Scattering → Focused Commitment
- **Old:** 5 projects at 20% each = 0 results
- **New:** 1 project at 100% for 60 days = proof of concept

## THE VOICE THAT WILL SHOW UP

**Around Email #3:**
*"This isn't working. You can't make shit happen. You need a better strategy. Maybe you should research more. Maybe you should build a tool to optimize this. Maybe Tricia should do the outreach instead."*

**Around Email #30 (if no responses yet):**
*"See? I told you. You can't make shit happen. This was a waste of time. You should pivot to something else. Maybe the BJJ tools. Maybe just help the gym instead."*

**Around Email #60 (the mid-week slump):**
*"This is too hard. You're not good at sales. You should just stick to building things behind the scenes. Let someone else do the front-facing work."*

**When first rejection/no-response comes:**
*"See? They don't want what you're offering. You're not good enough. You should give up."*

---

## THE RESPONSE PROTOCOL

**When the voice shows up:**

1. **Pause:** Take 3 deep breaths
2. **Acknowledge:** "Oh, there's that old belief. Hi, little Michael. I see you trying to protect me."
3. **Don't argue:** Don't try to convince yourself you CAN make shit happen (that's forcing)
4. **Compassionate firmness:** "Thank you for trying to keep me safe. I'm sending the email anyway."
5. **Act:** Send the fucking email
6. **Log it:** Track in app that the voice showed up and you acted anyway

**Key Principle:** You don't need to believe you can make shit happen. You just need to ACT AS IF and collect evidence.

## SUCCESS METRICS (What Actually Matters)

### Primary Metric: Did I Execute Despite the Voice?
- Target: 90 emails sent by Friday
- This is the only metric that proves "I CAN make shit happen"

### Secondary Metrics: External Results
- Reply rate (10-20% = 9-18 replies expected)
- Discovery calls booked (1-3 expected)
- Events closed (0-1 expected in Week 1)

### Tertiary Metric: Identity Shift
- By Friday, when I look in the mirror, do I see someone who can execute?
- When the voice says "you can't make shit happen," does it have less power?
- Am I building evidence of my capability?

---

## ENERGY & ABUNDANCE PRACTICE

### Before Taking Action (Sending Emails)

**Don't send from:**
- Scarcity: "I hope this works, please respond, I need this"
- Proving: "I'll show everyone I can make shit happen"

**Send from:**
- Curiosity: "I'm willing to find out what happens"
- Worthiness: "I'm offering something valuable" (even if I don't fully feel it yet)
- Service: "I'm here to help companies create better team culture"

**The Pre-Send Ritual:**
1. Close eyes
2. Take 5 deep breaths
3. Feel yourself as already successful (not forcing, just trying on the energy)
4. Connect to gratitude for what's coming
5. Send the email from that place

---

## FAILURE PROTOCOLS

### If Zero Responses After 90 Emails

**Old Pattern Response:**
- "See? I can't make shit happen. I should give up. I should help Tricia instead. I should research more. I should try a different business."

**New Pattern Response:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "That didn't work. AND I proved I can execute 90 times."
2. **Analyze:** What can I learn? Was the messaging off? Wrong target audience? Wrong channel?
3. **Pivot:** Adjust and run another 90 emails with new approach
4. **Key reframe:** "I CAN make shit happen. The first approach didn't work. That's data, not identity."

### If Tricia's Outreach Works Better Than Mine

**Old Pattern Response:**
- "She's better than me. I'm not good at this. I should just support her and stay in the background."

**New Pattern Response:**
1. **Celebrate:** "This is great data! What's working for her?"
2. **Learn:** Study her approach, tone, personalization
3. **Integrate:** Apply what works while staying in my power
4. **Key reframe:** "Her success doesn't diminish my capability. I can learn and improve."

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER GOALS

### The BJJ x AI Tools Dream
- **Status:** Built working app (Submission Specialist), got influencer interest (Jack Krucial)
- **Block:** "I don't have authority yet to build BJJ tools"
- **Reality:** You have more authority than 90% of people (you built a working product)
- **After DecoponATX Week 1:** If you proved you can execute on THIS, you can execute on THAT

### Building in Public / Newsletter
- **Current state:** Dan Koe courses purchased, no execution
- **Block:** "I don't have authority to teach/share"
- **Reality:** Your journey FROM "I can't make shit happen" TO "I executed 90 emails" IS the content
- **Next step:** After proving execution capability, document the journey

### Long-term Vision
- **Financial freedom through business**
- **Mastery of BJJ**
- **Building tools that serve martial arts community**
- **Being a creator/builder in public**

**Key insight:** All roads lead through proving "I CAN make shit happen" first. That's the unlock.

- **Resistance log:** When did the voice show up? What did it say? Did I act anyway?

### Evening Reflection

- **Reminder of the why:** "You're proving to that 5-year-old that he can survive wanting something and going for it"
- **Visual progress:** Some kind of visual representation of emails sent (progress bar, chart)

---

## FINAL CONTEXT

**This is not about:**
- Making $10K/month (that's a byproduct)
- Helping Tricia succeed (though that's nice)
- Becoming a guru or authority (that's ego)

**This is about:**
- Healing the core wound from age 5
- Proving to himself that he CAN make shit happen
- Building evidence of capability through action
- Shifting from "I help others" to "I can build my own empire"

**The real success:**
By Friday, January 3rd, when Michael looks in the mirror, he sees someone who:
- Committed to 90 emails and delivered
- Faced the voice that said "you can't" and acted anyway
- Survived rejection, non-response, and uncertainty
- Collected evidence that he IS capable of making shit happen

**Everything else is just data.**

## KEY PHRASES TO REINFORCE

**When doubt shows up:**
- "Thank you for trying to protect me. I'm doing it anyway."
- "That was ONE email. I'm sending 89 more. Watch me."
- "I don't need to believe I can. I just need to act as if."

**When resistance shows up:**
- "This discomfort means I'm growing."
- "The voice gets louder right before the breakthrough."
- "I'm not avoiding the pain anymore. I'm walking through it."

**When seeking external validation:**
- "I don't need permission. I'm giving it to myself."
- "There are no guarantees. I'm willing to find out anyway."
- "My worthiness isn't determined by results. It's inherent."

---

## ENERGY ALIGNMENT

**Before every action, ask:**
- Am I doing this from scarcity or abundance?
- Am I proving or discovering?
- Am I forcing or allowing?
- Am I in my old identity or trying on the new one?

**The goal:** Act from a place of "I'm already worthy, and I'm curious what happens" rather than "I need to prove I'm worthy by getting results."

---

**END OF CONTEXT DOCUMENT**

This is who Michael is, where he's been, what he's working through, and what he's committing to. Use this to build a daily accountability app that tracks his execution, witnesses his resistance, celebrates his wins, and reminds him of the real mission: proving to that 5-year-old that he CAN, in fact, make shit happen.
