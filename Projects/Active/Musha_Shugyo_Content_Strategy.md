## Claude Automation Workflows

### Daily Tweet Generation

**Input (Voice Memo or Notes):**
> "Today I noticed [observation]. It made me think about [connection]. The lesson is [insight]."

**Prompt to Claude:**
> "Turn this into 2 tweets using my tweet structures. Pillar focus today: [Health/Entrepreneurship/Martial Arts/Systems]. Keep my voice — direct, no fluff, grounded in experience."

### Weekly Newsletter Draft

**Input:** Raw notes, voice memos, week's observations

**Prompt to Claude:**
> "Draft a newsletter on [topic]. Use my framework: Hook (specific moment) → Story (expand it) → Lesson (principle) → Application (practical takeaway). 1,000-1,500 words. My voice: direct, philosophical but practical, no victim framing."

### Resistance Logging

**Quick capture format:**
> "Resistance: [what the voice said]. Action: [what I did anyway]. Result: [what happened]."

Claude can compile these weekly into a "Resistance Report" for reflection.

## Key Principles

1. **Sovereignty > Victimhood** — You chose this path. Own it.
2. **Consistency > Perfection** — 2 tweets daily beats 10 tweets once.
3. **Document > Create** — Share what you're living, not theorizing.
4. **Systems > Willpower** — Build infrastructure that makes action easy.
5. **Revenue NOW** — Health coaching is ready. Don't wait.
6. **Everything Connects** — Health, business, training, systems — one integrated life.

---

## Important Notes

- No victim framing around ADHD — reframe as "brain that needs different systems"
- No spouse mentions — keep personal life private
- DecoponATX stays separate from personal brand content
- Voice memo is primary capture method — reduces friction
- Claude is co-pilot, you are captain — heavy direction from you always
