# Prompt for Claude Code - Strategy Session

Read these files for context:
- Memory/identity.md (who I am, ADHD patterns)
- Memory/goals.md (current goals: DecoponATX business, health recovery, writing project)
- Memory/observations.md (what works for me)
- Projects/Active/Musha_Shugyo_Content_Strategy.md (my full writing system + schedule)
- Digital Economics course in Courses folder

## CONTEXT ON MY WRITING APPROACH:

[PASTE YOUR ELITE WRITER SYSTEM PROMPT HERE - the Naval/Handley/Ogilvy synthesis you shared earlier]

## YOUR TASK:

1. Study Digital Economics course - identify monetization strategies that fit my situation
2. Evaluate my Musha Shugyo writing plan against monetization timeline
3. Clarify what I should write about (BJJ white belt angle vs other options)
4. Design Claude Opus 4.5 automation for consistency (I heavily influence direction/content)
5. Create unified plan integrating:
   - Writing project (topic + schedule + automation)
   - DecoponATX business (email challenge Jan 6-10 still on track)
   - Content monetization strategy

## CONSTRAINTS:

- Be token-efficient (I'm near usage wall)
- I have ADHD - simple > complex
- Focus on actionable plan, not theory
- Health priority this week: nerve damage recovery, MRI, Dr. Pharm appt Dec 29

## OUTPUT:

Concise unified plan in natural language (markdown format) that I can share with my PersonalOS AI to sync memory files.

Ready when you are.
