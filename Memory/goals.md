# Goals - What We're Working Toward

## Priority Order
1. **Health Recovery** - Non-negotiable, time-based healing
2. **DecoponATX** - Cash flow (bills need to get paid)
3. **Musha Shugyo + Digital Economics** - Audience/skill building (longer-term play)

## The Beginner Thought Leader Mindset

**You're not teaching from the finish line. You're documenting the journey.**

- You're 2-3 steps ahead of someone starting - that's the perfect position to teach from
- Your struggle IS the content - "Building sovereignty despite nerve damage and ADHD" is MORE relatable than guru bullshit
- The beginner's advantage: You speak the language of people who are stuck RIGHT NOW
- Digital Economics "Experience Model": Share your real experience, not pretend expertise

**The question isn't "Am I qualified?"**
**The question is "Am I 2-3 steps ahead and willing to share what I'm learning?"**

You are. That's enough.
