PART I
Strategic Foundation
1. Executive Summary
The Business
DecoponATX brings Japanese-style phone case decorating workshops to corporate teams, private parties, and individual creators in Austin, Texas. Participants use whipped cream-textured glue and curated charms to create custom phone cases they keep and use daily.
Why It Works
The product is inherently visual and tactile. When someone sees a finished decoden case or holds one in their hands, they immediately understand the appeal. This creates a natural sales advantage: the product sells itself when shown, not when described.
The Strategy
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Corporate events generate cash flow and create content. Every event produces photos, videos, and testimonials that fuel all other channels.
Phase 2 (Months 2-4): Partnership relationships mature. Event planners, bachelorette coordinators, and hotel concierges begin referring clients.
Phase 3 (Months 3-6): E-commerce launches, built on proven messaging and visual assets from successful events.
Key Insight
Events are not just a revenue stream—they are the content engine that powers everything else. One corporate event produces: 20+ photos, 3-5 video clips, 2-3 testimonials, and 10+ potential referral sources. This content sells kits online, validates your pitch to partners, and builds social proof. Without events, you're trying to sell an experiential product with stock photos. With events, you have real proof.
Financial Targets
	•	Month 1: $2,000-3,000 (3-4 events)
	•	Month 3: $5,000-7,000 (5-6 events + early e-commerce)
	•	Month 6: $8,000-12,000 (events + partnerships + e-commerce)
	•	Year 1: $80,000-120,000 cumulative
Note: These projections are intentionally conservative. See Section 22 for detailed assumptions and upside scenarios.
2. The Visual-First Hypothesis
⚠️ This is a hypothesis to test, not a proven fact. We'll validate it in the first 30 days and adjust if wrong.
The Hypothesis
Decoden is a visual product selling an experiential outcome. Text-based outreach (cold email) will underperform visual outreach (in-person demos, video DMs, content) because prospects cannot accurately imagine the product from description alone.
Supporting Logic
When an HR manager reads 'phone case decorating workshop,' they likely imagine something like a basic craft painting session. Their mental model is wrong, and text can't fix that. When they see a video of the whipped cream texture, the charms being placed, people laughing while creating—they immediately understand this is different.
Counter-Argument
Many B2B services sell through text alone. Consultants, agencies, and software companies close deals without video demos. A well-written email might work fine. We shouldn't over-engineer based on an untested assumption.
How We'll Test It
In the first 30 days, we'll run parallel channels:
	•	Track 1: Visual-first (networking with case, LinkedIn video DMs, content)
	•	Track 2: Text-first (cold email automation, text-only LinkedIn)
At Day 30, we compare: discovery calls generated, close rates, and time invested. Data decides.
Decision Point
If visual outperforms text by 2x+: Double down on visual channels, use automation for volume only.
If text performs comparably: Lean into automation for efficiency, reduce in-person time commitment.
If both underperform: Reassess offer, pricing, or targeting.

3. Market Opportunity
The Phone Case Market
Global phone case market projected at $41.4 billion by 2030. Gen Z treats cases as fashion accessories and identity statements. Personalization trend drives demand for unique options.
Trending Aesthetics (2024-2025)
	•	Coquette: Bows, ribbons, pearls, soft pinks. Pinterest 'bow' searches up 900% in 2024.
	•	Y2K Revival: Butterflies, holographic, chrome, maximalist layering.
	•	Sanrio Characters: Hello Kitty, Kuromi, Cinnamoroll resurgence with K-pop crossover.
Austin Market Specifics
	•	7,500+ startups
	•	50,000+ tech workers
	•	Major employers: Amazon (7K), IBM (6K), Tesla (5K)
	•	Top-5 bachelorette party destination
	•	Culture values unique, Instagram-worthy experiences
Competitive Landscape
Direct competitors in decoden workshops: minimal in Austin. Indirect competitors: paint nights (~$35-45/person), escape rooms (~$30-40/person), cooking classes (~$75-100/person). We're positioned in the premium creative workshop tier with higher perceived value and tangible takeaway.

4. Defining Success: Lifestyle vs. Growth
Before executing, you must answer: What does 'enough' look like? This answer changes everything about which strategies to prioritize.
Path A: Lifestyle Business
	•	Target: $100,000-150,000/year revenue, $80,000-120,000 profit
	•	Structure: Solo operator, maybe one part-time assistant
	•	Workload: 8-12 events/month, manageable content, limited partnerships
	•	Lifestyle: Flexibility, creative fulfillment, sustainable pace
	•	Exit: None planned—this is the destination
Path B: Growth Company
	•	Target: $300,000-500,000/year by Year 2, $1M+ by Year 4
	•	Structure: Team of facilitators, operations manager, content team
	•	Workload: CEO role—hiring, systems, partnerships, strategy
	•	Lifestyle: Higher stress, management responsibilities, bigger impact
	•	Exit: Possible sale, franchise model, or holding company
Why This Matters Now
Path A optimizes for margin and sustainability. Path B optimizes for growth and scale. The first 90 days look similar, but decisions at Month 4+ diverge significantly. Knowing your destination helps you make consistent choices.
Recommendation: Start with Path A assumptions. Prove the model works solo. The option to scale remains open. But don't build infrastructure for Path B before validating Path A.

PART II
The Offers
5. Grand Slam Offer Stack
Every offer is designed using the Hormozi Value Equation: Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Achievement) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice). We maximize the numerator and minimize the denominator.
Offer A: Corporate Team Events (Primary)
The Promise: "A team experience they'll actually remember—and use every day."
Package
Price
Includes
Team Creative Session
$750 (up to 10)
All supplies, 90-min facilitation, cleanup
Additional Guests
$65/person
Same full inclusions
Premium Add-On
+$150
Licensed character charms (Sanrio, etc.)

Unit Economics: $750 revenue - ~$100 COGS = $650 gross profit (87% margin). This allows significant customer acquisition cost tolerance.
Offer B: Private Events (Bachelorettes, Birthdays)
	•	Bachelorette Package: $500-600 for 8-12 guests

The Bundle ($59-79):
	•	Premium clear phone case (customer's model)
	•	2x pro-cream glue tubes
	•	Curated charm set (50+ pieces)
	•	Professional tools
	•	Video tutorial access
	•	

6. Pricing Strategy & Validation Plan
⚠️ Pricing is assumed, not proven. Validate in first 5 discovery calls.
Validation Protocol
	•	Quote $750 confidently in first 5 discovery calls
	•	Track responses: enthusiastic yes, negotiation, hard no
	•	If 3+ of 5 close without price resistance: pricing validated
	•	If 3+ of 5 push back hard: test $650 or add more value
	•	Document exact objections for script refinement
Pricing Psychology
Anchor high: Start conversations with the premium option. "Most teams do our full experience at $750, but we can customize for different group sizes."
Per-person reframe: $750 for 10 people = $75/person. TopGolf runs similar, with nothing to take home.
ROI framing: "Your team will use these cases for 1-2 years. That's daily brand impressions and conversation starters."
Competitive Reference Points
	•	Paint and sip nights: $35-45/person
	•	Escape rooms: $30-40/person
	•	Cooking classes: $75-100/person
	•	Premium workshops (floristry, pottery): $80-120/person
At $75/person, we're at the high end of team activities but justified by premium materials, skilled facilitation, and a tangible takeaway that provides ongoing utility.

Go-To-Market Strategy
7. Channel Hierarchy & Parallel Testing
The 30-Day Parallel Test
Rather than betting everything on one approach, we run two tracks simultaneously for 30 days and let data decide.
Track A: High-Touch Visual (60% of effort)
	•	In-person networking with phone case
	•	LinkedIn warming sequence with video DMs
	•	Warm network referral requests
	•	Content creation (TikTok/Instagram)
Track B: Automation & Scale (40% of effort)
	•	Email domain warmup (runs in background)
	•	Build Exa + Claude lead research system
	•	Marketplace listings (Thumbtack, Google Business)
	•	Facebook group posts

8. In-Person Networking
Why This Channel
Your phone case is your best sales tool. When someone holds a finished decoden case, they're not evaluating a pitch—they're experiencing the product. Their skepticism dissolves. Questions come from genuine interest.
Target Events
	•	Tech networking: Austin Tech Happy Hour, Capital Factory events
	•	HR-specific: Austin SHRM chapter, People Ops meetups
	•	Women in tech: Women Who Code Austin, Austin Women in Technology
	•	General business: Austin Young Chamber, BNI chapters
The Playbook
Setup: Carry your most impressive showpiece case. Hold phone in ways that make it visible—hand it to them to type their number.
When someone comments: Don't pitch immediately. "Thanks! I'm kind of obsessed with it." Let them ask where you got it.
The reveal: "I actually made it—I run workshops where teams do this together." Hand them the case: "Feel it."
The transition: "I'd love to send you a video showing what it looks like. What's your email?"
Follow-up: Within 24 hours, send personalized video message referencing your conversation.
Time Investment
2-3 events per week × 2-3 hours each = 6-9 hours weekly, plus follow-up time. This is significant. If networking proves low-conversion after 30 days, reduce to 1 event/week and reallocate time.

9. LinkedIn Warming Sequence
The 3-Step Sequence
Step 1: Connection Request (Day 1)
Personalized request, no pitch. Establish relevance only.
"Hey Sarah - I work with Austin tech teams on creative culture experiences. Would love to connect."
Step 2: Engagement (Days 3-5)
If they post content, like and comment. If not, skip to Step 3 after 5 days.
Step 3: Video Pitch (Days 5-7)
Send DM with embedded video. LinkedIn autoplays, reducing friction.
"Hey Sarah - wanted to share something I think might be interesting for your team. We do phone case decorating workshops—it's become a favorite for team events because everyone leaves with something they actually use. Here's a quick look: [VIDEO]"
Weekly Targets
	•	Connection requests sent: 50/week
	•	Expected accepts: 25-30/week
	•	Video pitches sent: 20-25/week
	•	Expected responses: 4-6/week
	•	Expected calls booked: 2-3/week
Time Investment
10 connections + engagement + 5 pitches daily = 1-1.5 hours/day. Significant but systematizable.

10. Partnership Development
⚠️ Partnership timelines are typically 2-6 months from first contact to first referral. Don't expect Month 1 revenue from this channel.
The Value of Partnerships
One relationship with an event planner who trusts you becomes a source of multiple bookings over years. This is the difference between hunting (direct outreach) and farming (partnerships). You need both, but farming compounds.

11. Content Strategy
Content Serves Two Purposes
1. Direct Discovery: People find you through TikTok/Instagram algorithms
2. Credibility: When LinkedIn prospects check your profile, they see social proof
The Hero Video (Priority #1)
Create one 60-90 second video that becomes your core sales asset. Use everywhere: LinkedIn pitches, website, follow-up emails, partnership meetings.
Must include:
	•	The aesthetic (finished case glamour shots)
	•	The process (cream piping, charm placement)
	•	The experience (people creating, reactions)
	•	The outcome (finished cases, takeaways)
Timeline: Create v1 in first 4 hours. Ship imperfect. Iterate based on feedback.
Ongoing Content Rhythm
	•	TikTok: 1-2 posts daily (batch create on weekends)
	•	Instagram Reels: 1 daily (repurpose TikTok)
	•	Instagram Feed: 3-4 per week (curated portfolio)
Content Types That Convert
	•	ASMR Process Videos: Cream piping sounds, charm clicking
	•	Before/After: Blank case to finished product
	•	Workshop Behind-the-Scenes: Setup, participants, results
	•	Customer Reactions: Genuine excitement moments










12. Landing Page Strategy
Your landing page is where every channel converges. LinkedIn prospects check your link. Networking contacts visit after meeting you. Content viewers click through from your bio. If this page doesn't convert, you're leaking leads from every channel.
The Visual-First Homepage
Above the fold (first screen, no scrolling):
	•	Hero video (60-90 sec) autoplaying muted or with prominent play button
	•	One headline: "Creative Workshops Your Team Will Actually Remember"
	•	One subhead: "Phone case decorating experiences for Austin corporate teams"
	•	One CTA button: "Book a Workshop"
Below the fold:
	•	Gallery of 6-8 finished cases (show aesthetic range)
	•	3-4 workshop photos (real people creating, laughing, showing off results)
	•	How it works: 3 simple steps with icons (We bring everything → Your team creates → Everyone leaves with a custom case)
	•	Social proof: 2-3 testimonials with names and photos
	•	Pricing: "Starting at $750 for up to 10 people. $65 per additional guest."
	•	FAQ: 4-5 common questions (How long? What do we need to provide? What phone models?)
	•	Final CTA: "Book a Workshop" button
Booking Flow
Keep it simple. Two options:
Option A (Recommended for now): "Book a Workshop" opens Calendly for a 15-minute discovery call. You qualify live, answer questions, close on the call.
Option B (Later, once proven): Direct booking form—date, group size, contact info, phone models. Requires more automation but reduces friction for ready buyers.
Start with Option A. Move to Option B once you're getting enough inbound that calls become a bottleneck.
Technical Requirements
	•	Mobile-optimized (most traffic from Instagram/TikTok bio clicks)
	•	Fast load time (compress images, host video on YouTube/Vimeo and embed)
	•	Clear contact info (email, phone) for people who don't want to book online
	•	Google Analytics or simple tracking to see where traffic comes from
Implementation Timeline
Day 1-3: Update homepage with hero video and basic structure Day 7: Add workshop photos after first event Day 14: Add first testimonials Ongoing: Refresh gallery and testimonials as you accumulate content
The landing page improves with every event. Each workshop generates new photos, new testimonials, new social proof. The page compounds.
13. Automation Systems
Automation runs in parallel with high-touch channels. It's not primary in Month 1, but it's being built for scale.
System 1: Lead Research (Exa AI + Claude)
What it does: Finds target companies and contacts, enriches with personalization hooks, outputs to Google Sheets.
Build timeline: Weekend of Week 2
Value: Eliminates 1-2 hours daily of manual research
System 2: Event Discovery (Exa)
What it does: Finds Austin networking events weekly, scores by target audience fit, emails you a curated list every Sunday 
DecoponATX_Websets_Search_Strategy.xlsx
Build timeline: Weekend of Week 2
Value: No more manual event hunting
System 3: Cold Email (SendGrid)
What it does: Sends personalized emails at scale with human-like timing, tracks opens/replies, follows up automatically.
Build timeline: Weeks 3-4 (domain warmup takes 2-3 weeks)
Value: Volume play. 1/200 emails books a call = 2+ calls/month passively
Why Build If High-Touch Works?
High-touch requires your presence. If you're sick, traveling, or busy with events, outreach stops. Automation keeps generating leads whether you're working or not. It's a hedge against single-point-of-failure risk.

18. Decision Points & Kill Criteria
Pre-defined decision points prevent endless pivoting. We commit to strategies long enough to get real data, then make hard choices.
Day 30: Channel Allocation Decision
Data to review: Discovery calls from Track A (visual) vs. Track B (automation). Time invested in each. Close rates.
If Track A 2x+ better: Shift to 80% high-touch, 20% automation.
If similar: Maintain 60/40 split, continue building automation for leverage.
If Track B better: Shift to 60% automation, 40% high-touch. Reduce networking time.
Day 45: Partnership Kill Criteria
If: 5+ partnership demos completed with zero referrals generated...
Then: Reduce partnership development time by 50%. Focus on direct outreach and content. Revisit partnerships at Month 4 with more social proof.
Day 60: Pricing Decision
If: Close rate below 20% with consistent price objections...
Then: Test $650 base price for one month. Add value (premium charms included) rather than cutting price if possible.
Day 90: Business Viability Check
If: Cumulative revenue below $6,000 (50% of conservative target)...
Then: Fundamental reassessment. Either pivot offer significantly, expand geography, or evaluate whether market timing is wrong.
Content Performance Kill Criteria
If: After 30 days and 50+ posts, average views below 200 and zero inbound leads from content...
Then: Reduce content time investment. Focus on using content as sales support (LinkedIn pitches) rather than discovery channel.

19. Sales Scripts & Objection Handling
Discovery Call Framework
Opening:
"Thanks for taking the time! Before I dive in, what prompted you to explore this?"
Discovery:
	•	"How many people typically involved?"
	•	"What team activities have worked before? What hasn't?"
	•	"What's the timeframe you're thinking?"
The Pitch (share screen, show video):
"Let me show you what this actually looks like... The magic is everyone leaves with something they'll use every day."
Close:
"Does this feel like a fit? Great—let's lock in a date. What works better, [Option A] or [Option B]?"
Objection Responses
"That's more than we usually spend."
"Totally get it. At this price for [X] people, that's $[per-person]. TopGolf runs similar with nothing to take home. Your team uses these cases for years—cost per impression is actually really low."
"I need to get approval."
"Absolutely. Want me to send a one-pager to share? What's their main concern likely to be? Let me address that directly."
"Not sure everyone would be into this."
"That's the most common concern. The skeptics often have the most fun. It's not about being crafty—it's low-pressure, and people actually talk. The cases just give everyone something to do with their hands."

Conservative = 70% of aggressive targets. Assumes slower partnership development and modest e-commerce growth. Upside case: $120,000-150,000 Year 1.
23. Seasonality Planning
Corporate Events
	•	Peak: Q4 (holiday parties), Q1 (team kickoffs)
	•	Slow: Mid-summer (July-August), late December
Bachelorettes
	•	Peak: Spring-Fall (April-October)
	•	Slow: Winter (November-February)
Mitigation Strategy
The two segments are counter-cyclical. When corporate slows in summer, bachelorettes peak. When bachelorettes slow in winter, corporate picks up for holiday parties. E-commerce provides steady baseline regardless of season.

24. KPIs & Milestones

PART VII
Risk Management
25. Known Risks & Mitigations
Single Point of Failure (You)
Risk: If you're sick or unavailable, all operations stop.
Mitigation: Build automation for lead gen. Document processes for eventual assistant. Keep pipeline full so short gaps don't create revenue crises.

Risk: Market won't pay $750.
Mitigation: Test in first 5 calls. Adjust quickly based on data. Have value-add options rather than just cutting price.
Partnership Timeline Longer Than Expected
Risk: Partnerships take 6 months instead of 2-3.
Mitigation: Don't depend on partnership revenue in first 90 days. Treat it as bonus, not baseline.
Content Doesn't Gain Traction
Risk: TikTok/Instagram algorithms don't favor your content.
Mitigation: Use content for sales support (LinkedIn pitches) even if discovery channel underperforms. Don't bet everything on going viral.
Seasonality Worse Than Expected
Risk: Summer corporate drought deeper than projected.
Mitigation: Build bachelorette pipeline aggressively in Q1-Q2. Use slow periods for system building and content creation.
26. What Could Kill This Business
Being honest about existential risks:
1. Tech Recession in Austin
If major layoffs hit Austin tech companies, team-building budgets evaporate. This is outside your control. Mitigation: Diversify to non-tech corporates, lean into bachelorette/private events, consider geographic expansion.
2. Execution Failure
The strategy doesn't matter if you don't execute. Analysis paralysis, perfectionism, and fear of rejection kill more businesses than bad strategy. Mitigation: Commit to daily minimums regardless of motivation. Track activity, not just results.
3. Burnout
Solo operator doing events, sales, marketing, operations, and content is a lot. If you burn out in Month 4, everything collapses. Mitigation: Build sustainable rhythm from Day 1. Schedule rest. Hire help as soon as cash flow allows.
4. Commodity Competition
If decoden workshops become common in Austin, your differentiation erodes. Mitigation: Build brand, accumulate reviews, lock in partnerships. First-mover advantage compounds if you execute.

APPENDICES
Appendix A: Influential Frameworks Beyond Hormozi
This plan draws primarily on Alex Hormozi's value equation and offer frameworks. Other voices worth studying:
April Dunford (Obviously Awesome)
Positioning against alternatives. Key question: Why decoden vs. paint night vs. escape room? Define your competitive frame.
Donald Miller (Building a StoryBrand)
Message clarity. The customer is the hero; you're the guide. Simplify your pitch to the core transformation.
Chet Holmes (The Ultimate Sales Machine)
The 'Dream 100' concept: Identify 100 ideal accounts and pursue relentlessly rather than spraying broadly. Relevant for partnership development.
Mike Michalowicz (Profit First)
Cash flow management for service businesses. Take profit first, operate on what remains. Essential as revenue grows.
Daniel Priestley (Oversubscribed)
Create demand that exceeds capacity. Never desperate for clients. Build waitlists and scarcity.
Paul Jarvis (Company of One)
Question the assumption that growth is always good. Optimize for enough rather than endless scale.
