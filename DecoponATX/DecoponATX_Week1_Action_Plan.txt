KILL CRITERIA
If by Friday you have:
	•	< 5% reply rate → Email template is broken, rewrite completely
	•	10-20% reply rate but zero calls booked → Discovery call ask is weak, revise CTA
	•	Calls booked but can't close → Pricing or offer needs adjustment
If by Friday you have:
	•	1+ discovery call booked → You're on track, scale volume Week 2
	•	1 event closed → Model is proven, go ALL IN

DAILY RULES
✅ DO:
	•	Send emails every single day
	•	Respond to replies within 1 hour
	•	Update spreadsheet immediately after sending
	•	Follow up on Day 3 and Day 5
	•	Track what messaging gets responses
❌ DON'T:
	•	Build automation tools
	•	Redesign the website
	•	Research "better" email finder tools
	•	Optimize the tracking spreadsheet
	•	Plan Week 3 before finishing Week 1

IF YOU GET STUCK
Problem: Apollo credits run out → Switch to Hunter.io free credits (50/month) → If both run out, buy Snov.io for $39/month
Problem: Not sure what to personalize in emails → Check their LinkedIn for recent posts/announcements → Google "[Company name] news" for recent press → Mention their office location or recent growth
Problem: No one is replying → Don't panic until you've sent 50 emails → Try different subject lines → Add more specific personalization
Problem: Someone wants to book but you're not ready → Say yes anyway → Figure out logistics after you hang up → This is a good problem to have

NOW GO EXECUTE.
Report back Friday 4:30 PM with your weekly metrics.
