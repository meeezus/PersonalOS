# Musha Shugyo OS (MSOS)

A personal operating system for discipline, execution, and sovereignty. Built for ADHD minds that need structure without rigidity.

## What is MSOS?

MSOS is an AI-powered life operating system that combines:
- **Executive function support** - Task tracking, goal alignment, daily structure
- **Relationship management** - Contact tracking, stale relationship alerts
- **Health integration** - Oura Ring data for sleep/readiness
- **AI briefings** - Claude-powered morning overviews
- **Automation** - Scheduled jobs, Discord bot, email scanning

### Goals & Tasks

### Oura Integration
Syncs sleep, readiness, and activity scores. Morning briefings factor in your physical state.

### Agent System
TypeScript automation running on a scheduler:
- **Morning Overview** (8 AM) - AI briefing based on goals, tasks, calendar
- **Email Scanner** (4x daily) - Gmail analysis via MCP
- **Relationship Refresh** (Mondays) - Stale contact alerts

### Discord Bot
Commands: `!status`, `!overview`, `!goals`, `!capture`, `!contacts`

## Philosophy

Named after the Japanese concept of "warrior's pilgrimage" - a period of intense training and self-development. MSOS is built on three pillars:

1. **Sovereignty** - Own your data, your systems, your execution
2. **Discipline** - Structure that serves you, not constrains you
3. **Evidence** - Track wins to counter the "I can't make shit happen" voice

## Coming Soon

- **Abundance Warrior** - Daily mindset rituals for money/execution beliefs
- **Voice capture** - Quick logging via speech
- **Mobile PWA** - Full access from phone
