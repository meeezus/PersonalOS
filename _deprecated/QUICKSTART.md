# Personal AI System - Quick Start

## Starting OpenCode
```bash
cd ~/michaelenriquez/PersonalOS
# or just: pos
opencode
```

## Your First Interaction

1. **Ask what's there:**
"What files do I have in Tasks/Active?"

2. **Create your first project:**
"Create a new project for my DecoponATX business with notes about launching kawaii phone case workshops"

3. **Add a task:**
"Add task: Research corporate event venues in Austin. Due this Friday. Project: DecoponATX"

4. **Create a contact:**
"Create contact: Jane Smith, Event Coordinator at WeWork. Met at coffee shop, interested in team-building workshops"

5. **Review everything:**
"What's on my plate right now?"

## Daily Workflow Examples

**Morning:**
"What should I focus on today?"

**After a meeting:**
"Add to Jane's file: Had a call, she wants a proposal for 20-person workshop, budget is $1500, decision by Jan 15"

**Idea strikes:**
"Add to content ideas: How ADHD entrepreneurs can use AI to reduce context switching"

**Evening:**
"What did I accomplish today? What's pending?"

## Emergency Fallback

If OpenCode breaks:
- Your files are just markdown in ~/michaelenriquez/PersonalOS/
- Open in Obsidian and edit manually
- Everything still works
- Fix OpenCode later
