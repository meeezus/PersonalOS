# Prompt for Opus 4.5: Build Abundance Mindset Web App

## Context

I have a comprehensive Money Mindset & Abundance Guide (4-day program) that I want to turn into an **ongoing daily practice web app** to help me reprogram my money mindset and connect with divine/subconscious consciousness.

The guide is located at: `/Users/michaelenriquez/abundance/Money_Mindset_Abundance_Guide.md`

## What I Want You to Build

A **web application** (React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS) that transforms the 4-day foundation program into a sustainable, ongoing daily spiritual practice with these components:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Days 1-4: Original intensive program from the guide
  - Day 1: Money Autobiography (deep journaling)
  - Day 2: Energetic Clearing & Shadow Work (meditations, declarations)
  - Day 3: Identity Shift (future self visualization, identity rewriting)
  - Day 4: Reality Transurfing (energetic rehearsal, timeline choosing)

### Phase 2: Ongoing Daily Practice

**Morning Ritual (Structured, Required)**
- Gratitude journaling (3 money-related items)
- Daily affirmation (from personalized library)
- Visualization exercise
- Energy check-in (rate abundance vs scarcity)
- Connection to divine consciousness/subconscious
- Set intention: Choose your timeline for the day

**Evening Ritual (Structured, Required)**
- Log 3 wins from today
- Track evidence of abundance
- Reflection: Which timeline did you experience?
- Release practice
- Gratitude and closure

**Weekly Deep Work (Sundays, 30 min)**
- Pattern review
- Shadow work prompts
- Identity statement refinement
- Block identification and clearing

### Core Features

1. **Evidence Tracker**
   - Log all abundance evidence (money, opportunities, responses)
   - Visual graphs showing accumulation over time
   - Milestone celebrations

2. **Block Library**
   - The 4 main blocks from guide (Helper Identity, Scattered Energy, "Not Yet" Story, Money=Greed)
   - Ability to add personal blocks
   - Track which are being cleared
   - Mark as "integrated"

3. **Identity Evolution Timeline**
   - Track identity statements over time
   - Show transformation journey
   - Weekly refinement capability

4. **Streak Tracker**
   - Daily practice completion
   - Morning/evening ritual streaks
   - Days in "abundance energy"

5. **Insight Journal**
   - Rotating prompts based on current phase
   - Tag by theme (worthiness, scarcity, fear, etc.)
   - Search and review past insights

6. **Custom Affirmations Library**
   - Build personalized affirmation bank
   - Rate effectiveness
   - App suggests based on current blocks

7. **Energy Dashboard**
   - Daily energy rating (scarcity ↔ abundance spectrum)
   - Correlation tracking (energy vs results)
   - Pattern visualization

8. **Timeline Chooser**
   - Morning: Choose Timeline A (scarcity) or Timeline B (abundance)
   - Evening: Reflect on which you experienced
   - Visual history of choices

9. **Resistance Tracker**
   - Log when resistance appears
   - Identify "fear beneath the fear"
   - Suggested clearing practices

10. **Future Self Dialog**
    - Regular guided conversations with future abundant self
    - Record their wisdom
    - Review when guidance needed

## My Personal Requirements

1. **Structured Notifications/Reminders**: I need rigid structure to start. Make the morning and evening rituals mandatory checkpoints.

2. **Highly Personalized**: Use my personal context throughout. The app should feel like it's speaking directly to me, not generic users.

3. **Spiritual Aesthetic**: Calming, spiritual design with **samurai/musha shugyo themes** (warrior's journey, discipline, spiritual cultivation through practice). Think: minimalist Japanese aesthetics, warrior discipline meets spiritual enlightenment.

4. **Subconscious/Divine Connection**: Integrate practices that tap into divine consciousness and subconscious reprogramming - this isn't just habit tracking, it's spiritual transformation.

5. **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally (localStorage). No cloud, no accounts to start.

## Technical Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript** (for type safety and robust UI)
- **TailwindCSS** (for the samurai/spiritual aesthetic)
- **Chart.js** or similar (for visualization/tracking)
- **Local Storage** (all data stays private on device)
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** features for offline access and notifications
- Clean, minimal, focused interface

## Design Direction: Samurai Spiritual Warrior

- Color palette: Deep blacks, whites, gold accents, maybe subtle reds
- Typography: Clean, strong, disciplined
- Imagery themes: Path/journey, mountains, rising sun, warrior discipline
- Language: Frame the journey as a warrior's path to abundance mastery
- The daily practice is your "training" (like musha shugyo - warrior pilgrimage)

## What I Need From You

1. **Read the guide** at `/Users/michaelenriquez/abundance/Money_Mindset_Abundance_Guide.md` to understand all the concepts, practices, and exercises

2. **Build the complete web app** with all features above

3. **Make it beautiful** with the samurai spiritual aesthetic

4. **Ensure daily ritual structure** is clear and enforced (morning before noon, evening before bed)

5. **Add helpful context** - explain concepts from the guide inline where relevant

## Key Principles from the Guide to Integrate

- Identity is a thermostat (you self-sabotage when results exceed identity)
- Energy/vibration determines what you attract (quantum observer effect)
- Both mindset AND tactics required (not spiritual bypassing)
- Multiple parallel timelines exist - you choose through focus and belief
- Resistance is normal and reveals the blocks to clear
- Money is energy exchange, not just currency
- Shadow work reveals "fear beneath the fear"
- Future self visualization rewires identity

## Questions to Consider While Building

- Should detailed journaling be required or optional for each practice?
- How should the app guide someone through the initial 4-day intensive?
- Should there be different "difficulty levels" of practice (beginner rituals vs advanced)?
- How can the app detect when someone is in scarcity energy and intervene?

## Start Here

Begin by reading the guide, then create a plan for the app architecture. Show me the plan before building. I want to see:
- Component structure
- Data model (what gets stored)
- User flow (how someone moves through the app)
- Design mockup or description of key screens
- Technology decisions and rationale

Let's build something transformative.
