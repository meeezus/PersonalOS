# Build My Personal Abundance & Execution Warrior App

I want to build a daily mindset and execution accountability app. Read these two context documents that explain my core wound, limiting beliefs, money mindset journey, and current 90-day challenge.

## Context Documents

1. **`/Users/michaelenriquez/abundance/Michael_Mindset_Context.md`** - My personal story, core wound from age 5, limiting belief "I can't make shit happen", current DecoponATX challenge (90 emails in Week 1)

2. **`/Users/michaelenriquez/abundance/Money_Mindset_Abundance_Guide.md`** - 4-day abundance reclamation program covering money autobiography, energetic clearing, identity shift, and reality transurfing

## What I Need

Build me a web app that integrates BOTH contexts into one unified daily practice tool. This is for ME, not for anyone else.

### Core Features

**Daily Execution Tracking**
- Track daily email outreach volume (specific targets per day)
- Log when resistance/doubt shows up (the voice that says "I can't make shit happen")
- Record wins and evidence of capability
- Track replies, discovery calls booked, events closed

**Morning Ritual (Structured & Required)**
- Emotional state check-in: How am I feeling about today's outreach?
- The voice of doubt: What is the limiting belief saying right now?
- Acknowledgment practice: "I see you, little Michael. I'm doing it anyway."
- Affirmation: "I am willing to find out if I can make this happen"
- Energy alignment: Am I doing this from scarcity or abundance?
- Intention setting: Choose Timeline A (scarcity) or Timeline B (abundance) for today
- Pre-action ritual: 5 breaths, feel myself as already successful, send from worthiness

**Action Phase (Throughout Day)**
- Email counter with daily targets (Mon: 15, Tue-Thu: 20, Fri: 15)
- Running total for the week (goal: 90)
- Quick "Before Action" ritual trigger before sending emails
- Resistance logging when the voice shows up
- Response protocol reminder when needed

**Evening Reflection (Structured & Required)**
- 3 wins from today (even tiny ones count)
- Resistance moments: When did the voice show up? What did it say?
- How I responded: Did I act anyway or collapse into distraction?
- Evidence of capability: What proof did I create that I CAN make shit happen?
- Which timeline did I experience today?
- Tomorrow's commitment

**Weekly Deep Work (Sunday 30 min)**
- Total volume check: Did I hit 90 emails?
- Results summary: Reply rate, calls booked, revenue
- Pattern recognition: When did I want to scatter/distract/seek gurus?
- Identity shift tracking: On scale 1-10, how much do I believe "I can make shit happen"?
- Shadow work prompts from the abundance guide
- Money story reflection and rewriting

**Ongoing Money Mindset Integration**
- Money autobiography journaling space
- Track abundance evidence (money received, opportunities, positive responses)
- Blocks library: Helper Identity, Scattered Energy, "Not Yet" Story, Money=Greed, custom blocks
- Future self visualization and dialog
- Identity evolution timeline
- Energetic clearing practices from the guide

**Resistance & Voice Tracking**
- Predicted resistance moments logged (Email #3, #30, #60, first rejection)
- When the voice shows up, app guides through Response Protocol:
  1. Pause (3 deep breaths)
  2. Acknowledge: "Hi, little Michael. I see you trying to protect me."
  3. Don't argue
  4. Compassionate firmness: "Thank you for trying to keep me safe. I'm sending the email anyway."
  5. Act: Send the fucking email
  6. Log it

**Visual Progress & Motivation**
- Progress bars for daily/weekly email volume
- Evidence accumulation graph over time
- Streak tracker for daily ritual completion
- Energy dashboard (scarcity ↔ abundance spectrum)
- Timeline choice history visualization

**Key Phrase Reminders**
When doubt shows up:
- "Thank you for trying to protect me. I'm doing it anyway."
- "That was ONE email. I'm sending 89 more. Watch me."
- "I don't need to believe I can. I just need to act as if."

When resistance shows up:
- "This discomfort means I'm growing."
- "The voice gets louder right before the breakthrough."
- "I'm not avoiding the pain anymore. I'm walking through it."

When seeking external validation:
- "I don't need permission. I'm giving it to myself."
- "There are no guarantees. I'm willing to find out anyway."
- "My worthiness isn't determined by results. It's inherent."

## Design Direction: Samurai Spiritual Warrior (Musha Shugyo)

This is my warrior's journey to abundance mastery. The daily practice is my training.

**Visual Aesthetic:**
- Color palette: Deep blacks, whites, gold accents, subtle reds
- Typography: Clean, strong, disciplined (Japanese-inspired)
- Imagery themes: Path/journey, mountains, rising sun, warrior discipline
- Minimalist Japanese aesthetics meets spiritual cultivation
- Think: A warrior on a pilgrimage of self-mastery

**Language/Framing:**
- Daily practice = warrior training
- Email outreach = walking the path despite fear
- Resistance = the inner opponent to face
- Evidence collection = battle victories
- This isn't just habit tracking - it's spiritual transformation through disciplined action

## Technical Requirements

- **React + TypeScript** (robust, type-safe)
- **TailwindCSS** (for the warrior aesthetic)
- **Chart.js** or similar (visualization)
- **Local Storage** (all data private, no cloud)
- **PWA features** (offline access, notifications)
- Clean, minimal, focused interface

## Structured Notifications

I need rigid structure to start:
- Morning ritual reminder (before 9am)
- Daily email target reminder (if not hit by 2pm)
- Evening reflection reminder (before 9pm)
- Resistance check-in (when email count stalls)

## What Makes This Personal

This app speaks directly to ME:
- References "little Michael" and the carousel incident at age 5
- Knows my specific patterns: helping others, guru-seeking, scattering, analysis paralysis
- Tracks my specific challenge: DecoponATX 90 emails, $3K/month in 60 days
- Combines tactical execution (emails) with deep inner work (core wound healing)
- Not generic - every phrase, prompt, and feature is tailored to my journey

## The Real Mission

This is not about:
- Making $10K/month (that's a byproduct)
- Helping Tricia succeed (though that's nice)
- Becoming a guru or authority (that's ego)

This is about:
- Healing the core wound from age 5
- Proving to that 5-year-old that he CAN make shit happen
- Building evidence of capability through action
- Shifting from "I help others" to "I can build my own empire"
- Integrating money mindset work with execution accountability

## Success Criteria

By Friday, January 3rd, when I look in the mirror, I see someone who:
- Committed to 90 emails and delivered
- Faced the voice that said "you can't" and acted anyway
- Survived rejection, non-response, and uncertainty
- Collected evidence that I AM capable of making shit happen
- Connected deeper to my worthiness around money and capability

**Everything else is just data.**

## What I Need From You

1. **Read both context documents** to understand my full journey
2. **Design the app architecture** - show me the plan first:
   - Component structure
   - Data model (what gets stored)
   - User flow (morning → action → evening → weekly)
   - Key screens and their purpose
   - How the two contexts integrate
3. **Build it with the samurai aesthetic** - make it beautiful, minimal, powerful
4. **Make it deeply personal** - this is MY tool for MY transformation

Start by reading both documents, then show me your plan before building.

Let's create something that helps me walk the warrior's path to abundance and capability.
