# Personal AI System - Command Reference

## Core Philosophy
I have conversations with my AI about my life. It reads/writes to my actual files.

## The Three Pillars

### Tasks - Individual Action Items
Files in: `Tasks/Active/`

**Add a task:**
"Add task: Send follow-up email to Sarah about Q1 budget. Due Friday. Project: Budget Planning. Person: Sarah"

**Check tasks:**
"What tasks do I have for this week?"
"What's overdue?"
"Show me all tasks related to Sarah"

**Update task:**
"Mark 'email Sarah' as done"
"Move budget task to next Monday"

### Projects - Bigger Initiatives
Files in: `Projects/Active/`

**Create project:**
"Create a new project called 'DecoponATX Launch' with these notes: [context]"

**Update project:**
"Add to DecoponATX project: Met with supplier, quoted $500 for initial inventory"

**Review project:**
"Summarize the status of DecoponATX project"
"What's the next step on DecoponATX?"

### People - Personal CRM
Files in: `People/Contacts/`

**Create person file:**
"Create a contact for Sarah Johnson, HR Director at TechCorp. Met at networking event."

**Log interaction:**
"Add to Sarah's file: Had coffee today, discussed their Q1 team-building needs, she wants a proposal by Friday"

**Prepare for meeting:**
"What do I need to discuss with Sarah?"
"When did I last talk to Sarah and what about?"

## Cross-Pillar Commands

**Task → Project → Person:**
"Show me all tasks for DecoponATX project that involve Sarah"

**Weekly review:**
"Review this week: completed tasks, project progress, people I need to follow up with"

**Daily planning:**
"What should I focus on today based on my tasks, projects, and upcoming meetings?"

## Content Creation

**Capture ideas:**
"Add to content ideas: Insight about ADHD resistance patterns"

**Generate content:**
"Create a LinkedIn post about [topic] and save to Content/Posts/"

## File Management

**Search across everything:**
"Find all mentions of 'kawaii workshop' across tasks, projects, and people"

**Create note:**
"Create a note in Knowledge/Business about [topic]"
